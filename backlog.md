## [June 2, 2025] - Final Code Splitting & Bundle Optimization

- **Changed:**

  - Implemented lazy loading for highlight.js in MDRender component
  - Added lazy loading for Ollama browser module in worker
  - Configured manual chunking in Vite for vendor libraries
  - Fixed worker format configuration for ES modules
  - Removed heavy unified/remark dependencies in favor of lightweight markdown parser

- **Reason:**

  - Large bundle size (1,143 kB) impacting initial load performance
  - Heavy dependencies loaded upfront even when not immediately needed
  - Code splitting improves caching and loading strategies

- **Impact:**

  - **Bundle size reduced by 15%**: From 1,143.22 kB to 969.32 kB

  - **Better code splitting**: Vendor (16.13 kB), Ollama (16.03 kB), Worker (3.05 kB)
  - **Improved loading performance**: Critical features load first, optional features lazy-loaded
  - **Better browser caching**: Vendor libraries can be cached separately from app code

- **Technical Details:**
  - Replaced synchronous imports with dynamic import() for non-critical dependencies
  - Configured Vite manual chunking for optimal cache strategies
